"Exploring the Relationship between Stress and Health Parameters: An IoT-ML Driven Approach"
About this Project -

From the background study, we can say that the early we get info about symptoms/abnormal movement of our body, the more chance we have to save ourselves from disease/severe attacks. With the help of sensor, we are building a Stress Monitoring app which will display a Person's Heart rate, SpO2 (oxygen% in the body) level concentration , body temperature,Limb movement. Using MAX30100 Heart Rate Sensor we are measuring all these value and with the help of NodeMCU we are sending all these data to firebase cloud which will fetched by StressLess app made with MIT App inventor and displayed in the App. All the memeber can monitor their family member vitals and furthermore any abnormality in pulse rate/oxygen concentraion will be alerted to user .Using standerd value, the current condition will be displayed in the app.
